## inNINO Executable
1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that version 5 of the Octave is installed.   
If not, you can run the Octave installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the Octave prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the Octave installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the Octave from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/support
   
For more information about the Octave installer, see "Distribute Applications" in the Octave Compiler documentation.

3. Definitions

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave’s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.

GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation.
